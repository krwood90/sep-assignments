1 - Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

It would take 7 iterations using linear.


2 - Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

It would take 3 iterations using binary.


3 - Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
fib(10) = 55
fib(11) = 89
fib(12) = 144

4 - Given an unsorted collection of a million items, 
which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

I would choose a linear search due to it being unsorted and choose an iterative solution.


5 - Given a sorted collection of a million items, 
which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

I would use an recursive binary search due to it being sorted and that
many items to search through.
